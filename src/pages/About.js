              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                At Zencha, we believe in slowing down. Our journey started with a shared 
                love for the earthy, smooth taste of matcha ‚Äî a drink that's both 
                energizing and grounding. Founded in Manila, Zencha celebrates the art 
                of whisking as more than just a caf√© ritual; it's a lifestyle.
              </p>
              <p>
                We take pride in using authentic matcha sourced from trusted farms, 
                ensuring every sip is full of flavor and nutrients. Through our slow bar 
                experience and take-home matcha tins, we aim to make matcha accessible, 
                affordable, and mindful for everyone.
